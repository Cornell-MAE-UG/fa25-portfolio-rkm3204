## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/RachelMoore.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}{: .inline-image-r style="width: 400px"}

 
My name is Rachel Moore, and I am a Senior majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I am also minoring in Aerospace Engineering, creating a focus on my passion for the Aerospace Industry. My work blends engineering analysis with hands-on fabrication, data-driven experimentation, and a curiosity for how complex systems behave in the real world.

I’ve built and tested projects from wind-turbine blades to gliders to static thrust test rigs, and color-sensing autonomous robots. Across these projects, I’ve developed strong experience in MATLAB, Arduino, Python, and experimental aerodynamics tools such as pitot-static tubes, load cells, and hot-wire probes. I love combining coding, hardware, and physics to solve messy, open-ended engineering problems.

Outside of my work, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and trying new coffee shops!
I’m driven by curiosity, precision, and the desire to design systems that are technically innovative.
If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!
